Controller Status
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The output number 22 returns a controller status flag that can be usefull to better understand the behaviour of the controller under operations. The flag can have the following values:

- -2 when the turbine in idling before cut-in and the controller is pitching out;
- -1 during the start-up procedure;
- 0 when the controller is operating in power production;
- 1 shutdown activated when the filtered generator speed is higher than the overspeed limit. 
- 2 shutdown activated when  Input 10 is not 0. 
- 4 normal shutdown activated when  with the timer Input 26;
- 5 emergency shutdown activated when  with the timer Input 26;
- 3 shutdown activated when filtered tower top acceleration is higher than the safety limit. 
- 6 shutdown activated when the generator speed is negative.
